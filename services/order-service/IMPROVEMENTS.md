# Order Service Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Order Service to fix authentication issues and enhance database connectivity.

## Authentication Improvements

### 1. Standardized Authentication System

- Added dedicated `auth.middleware.ts` with two middleware functions:
  - `authMiddleware`: For regular user authentication
  - `adminAuthMiddleware`: For admin-only routes

- Improved error responses with:
  - Consistent format with success flag
  - More detailed error information in development
  - Better logging of authentication failures

### 2. Route Organization

- Reorganized routes into three categories:
  - Public routes (no auth required)
  - Protected routes (user auth required)
  - Admin routes (admin auth required)

- Each category uses the appropriate middleware:
  ```typescript
  // Public routes - no auth
  app.register(async (publicApp) => {
    await publicApp.register(publicOrderRoutes, { prefix: '/public/orders' });
  });

  // Protected routes - user auth
  app.register(async (protectedApp) => {
    protectedApp.addHook('preHandler', authMiddleware);
    await protectedApp.register(orderRoutes, { prefix: '/orders' });
  });

  // Admin routes - admin auth
  app.register(async (adminApp) => {
    adminApp.addHook('preHandler', adminAuthMiddleware);
    await adminApp.register(noteRoutes, { prefix: '/orders' });
  });
  ```

### 3. JWT Configuration

- Enhanced JWT error handling and validation
- Improved JWT secret configuration checking
- Added clear logging about JWT configuration status

## Database Connectivity Improvements

### 1. Robust Connection Handling

- Added retry mechanism for database connections:
  - Configurable retry attempts and delay
  - Detailed logging of connection attempts
  - Connection verification with test query

```typescript
export async function initializeDatabase(retryAttempts = 5, retryDelay = 3000) {
  // Retry logic for database connection
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Connection Pool Optimization

- Enhanced connection pool settings:
  - Increased max connections (20)
  - Optimized idle timeout (30s) and connection timeout (5s)
  - Added proper poolSize configuration

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

- Added disconnect detection and automatic reconnection
- Improved error reporting with detailed stack traces
- Added graceful connection closing on service shutdown

## Application Structure Improvements

### 1. Graceful Shutdown

- Added handlers for shutdown signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- Proper sequence for closing server and database connections
- Improved error handling during shutdown

### 2. Error Handling

- Enhanced global error handler:
  - Specialized handling for validation errors
  - Safe error messages in production
  - Consistent error response format

### 3. Logging Improvements

- Replaced console.log/error with structured logger
- Added detailed context to log messages
- Different log levels based on environment

## Testing & Debugging Tools

- Created JWT testing tools:
  - `generate-test-token.js`: For creating valid tokens
  - `debug-jwt.js`: For diagnosing token issues

- Added database testing helpers:
  - Connection verification
  - Test query execution

## Security Enhancements

- CORS configuration updated with:
  - Better origin validation
  - Appropriate headers for modern web applications
  - Protection against common CORS issues

- Improved error messages:
  - Detailed in development, safe in production
  - Non-leaking of sensitive information

## Next Steps

1. Complete the integration with API Gateway for seamless service communication
2. Add comprehensive integration tests for authentication flow
3. Consider implementing refresh tokens for improved security
4. Add monitoring for database connection pool usage
