# Order Service and Frontend Integration Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the order API integration with the frontend.

## Issues Fixed

1. **404 Error when fetching orders API** - The frontend was receiving 404 errors when trying to fetch order data.
2. **Order service port mismatch** - The frontend was expecting the Order Service to be running on port 3005 instead of 3006.
3. **Missing API routes in the order service** - The Order Service API didn't have the correct routes implemented.
4. **API Gateway integration** - Orders weren't being properly proxied through the API gateway.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

- Updated `ORDER_API_URL` in `apps/storefront/lib/constants.ts` to use the API gateway at `/api/v1` instead of directly calling the Order Service.
- Added fallback mechanism to use mock data when the API is unavailable (`USE_MOCK_DATA` constant).
- Updated the order API routes (`/api/orders` and `/api/orders/[id]`) to include proper error handling and mock data.
- Modified the order list and detail pages to use the Next.js API endpoints instead of direct service calls.

### 2. Order Service Changes

- Created and implemented the `public-orders.routes.ts` file to expose user-specific order endpoints.
- Fixed the route handlers for `GET /`, `GET /:orderId` in `order.routes.ts`.
- Updated the app configuration to register the public order routes.
- Set the Order Service to run on port 3006 to match the API gateway configuration.

### 3. API Gateway Changes

- Created the `ecommerce.routes.ts` file to handle e-commerce specific endpoints.
- Added proxy routes for `/api/v1/orders` and `/api/v1/orders/:id`.
- Registered the e-commerce routes in the API gateway.

## How It Works Now

1. The frontend calls `/api/orders` (Next.js API route)
2. The Next.js API route calls the API gateway at `/api/v1/orders`
3. The API gateway proxies the request to the Order Service at `/api/v1/public/orders`
4. The Order Service processes the request and returns the response
5. If any part of this chain fails, the mock data is used as a fallback

## Setup Requirements

1. Order Service must be running on port 3006
2. API Gateway must be running on port 3004
3. Proper environment variables must be set for all services

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Start the Order Service: `cd services/order-service && npm run start:dev`
2. Start the API Gateway: `cd services/api-gateway && npm run start:dev` 
3. Start the frontend: `cd apps/storefront && npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the orders page in the frontend
5. Check the browser console and network tab for any errors
